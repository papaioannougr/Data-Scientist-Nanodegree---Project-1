# Data-Scientist-Nanodegree---Project-1
This is the repository for files used and code programs written regarding Project 1 of Data Scientist Nano degree in Udacity

This project aims to utilize Airbnb data for certain regions (Boston and/or Seattle) and conduct an analysis which answers at least 3 questions derived from the data.

For this project I used Seattle data and tried to give insight in the following 3 topics:
1) Which is the easiest way to build a host profile about what kind of services they offer
2) What can a gust easily conclude by observing ratings?
3) Some descriptive and predictive analysis for price of using Airbnb services in Seattle

In this repository 4 files exist:

1) calendar.csv
2) reviews.csv
3) listings.csv
4) df_list.csv

The first 3 files were provided by Udacity. They were store in the following kaggle web page:
https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data

The fourth one was generated and extracted in csv in order to be used in other *.ipynb files

Additionally, there are 4 python code files:
1) GettingKnowWithData.ipynb
2) Question 1 - Host Profile.ipynb
3) Question 2 - Can we trust ratings.ipynb
4) Question 3 - trying to estimate the cost.ipynb

In the first one there are some checks in the datasets provided by kaggle in order to understand better them.
The last 3 are the analysis for each corresponding question regarding this project
